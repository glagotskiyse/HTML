<h1>Jackie Chan</h1>
<p>
    Datuk Fang Shilong (Chinese: 房仕龍; born 7 April 1954) SBS MBE PMW, born Chan Kong-sang
    (Chinese: 陳港生 About this soundlisten) and known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Kong actor, director,
    martial artist and stuntman known for his slapstick acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts,
    which he typically performs himself. Chan has been acting since the 1960s, performing in more than 150 films. He is
    one of the most popular action film stars of all time.

    Chan is one of the most recognisable and influential film personalities in the world, and he gained a widespread
    global following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. He has received fame stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of
    Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, films and video
    games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of
    music albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred. He is also a globally known
    philanthropist and has been named as one of the top 10 most charitable celebrities by Forbes magazine. In
    2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was perhaps the "most recognised film star in the world". In
    2015, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $350 million, and as of 2016, he was the second-highest-paid actor in the
    world.

    Since 2013, Chan has been a pro-Communist politician, serving in the Chinese People's Political Consultative
    Conference. After the Hong Kong electoral reform in 2021, Chan became an Election Committee member and could
    vote for the Chief Executive.

<h2>Jackie Chan filmography</h2>
<p>
    Jackie Chan began his film career as an extra child actor in the 1962 film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar. Ten years
    later, he was a stuntman opposite Bruce Lee in 1972's Fist of Fury and 1973's Enter the Dragon. He then had starring
    roles in several kung fu films, such as 1973's Little Tiger of Canton and 1976's New Fist of Fury. His first major
    breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, which was shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film
    Corporation under a two-picture deal. He then, enjoyed huge successes with similar kung fu action comedy films
    such as 1978's Drunken Master and 1980's The Young Master.

    In 1982, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences of Dragon Lord, which featured a
    pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and
    the final fight scene in which he performs various stunts, including one in which he does a back flip off a loft and
    falls to the lower ground. In 1983, Project A saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added
    elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a
    clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).

    Police Story (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase
    through a shanty town, Chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a
    shopping mall. This final scene earned the film the nickname "Glass Story" by the crew, due to the huge number of
    panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down the pole from
    several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering
    second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon
    landing. Chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several Police Story sequels,
    Project A Part II, the Armour of God series, Dragons Forever, Drunken Master II, Rumble in the Bronx, and the Rush
    Hour series, among others.

    In 1995, Rumble in the Bronx made Jackie Chan a mainstream celebrity in America. In 2000, Chan produced an animated
    series Jackie Chan Adventures, which ran until 2005. Starring a fictionalized version of himself voiced by James
    Sie with Chan himself appearing in live action in the opening theme and in the "Hey Jackie" segments at the end of
    each and every episode.

    In July 2008, the BTV reality television series titled The Disciple (simplified Chinese: 龙的传人; traditional Chinese:
    龍的傳人; lit. 'Disciple of the Dragon') concluded. The aim of the series, produced by and featured Chan, was to find a
    new star to become Chan's "successor" and student in film-making. The winner of the series was Jack Tu (Tu Sheng
    Cheng), who is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films, one of which was scripted by Chan, and all
    three to be co-produced by Chan's company JCE Movies Limited.

    In 2010, Jackie Chan appeared in his first dramatic role with Didda Mont in an American film, a remake of 1984's The
    Karate Kid as Mr. Han, opposite co-star Jaden Smith.Chan followed up the high-profile part with a minor role in
    Shaolin.

    Jackie Chan's 100th movie, 1911, which he co-directed, produced, and starred in, was released on September 26, 2011
    and in North America on October 14.While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this was his
    first directorial work since Who Am I? in 1998.

    While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he was
    getting too old for the genre. He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but
    would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.

    Jackie Chan's first film in 2017 was Kung Fu Yoga, released on January 27, 2017. Jackie Chan plays the role as Jack,
    a world-renowned archaeology professor. Jack and his team are on a grand quest to locate a lost ancient Indian
    treasure when they are ambushed by a team of mercenaries and left for dead. Using his vast knowledge of Asian
    history, yoga and kung fu, Jack leads his team on a race around the world to beat the mercenaries to the treasure
    and save an ancient culture in this breakneck action-comedy that reunites Chan with acclaimed director Stanley Tong.

    In Dragon Blade, a historical action film, Chan plays Huo An, the commander of the Protection Squad of the Western
    Regions during the Han Dynasty. The film was released on February 19, 2015.

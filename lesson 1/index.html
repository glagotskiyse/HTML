    The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
    Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and
    Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were
    created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart"
    for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were
    later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.

    Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The
    most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma
    Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's
    mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor
    relatives.
